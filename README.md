# Van's Transportation

 - Van's Transportation is a website designed for hassle-free bookings, allowing users to easily book the services they need. The site eliminates the need for lengthy phone calls, where responses are often delayed or require callbacks. Once a booking request is submitted through the website, administrators can promptly review and approve it, streamlining the process for both users and the company.

## Surface
### Color Scheme
- The color scheme of the website primarily consists of shades of grey, muted orange, and a few accent colors. The colors were chosen for simplicity, featuring a light color scheme with an accentuated orange to highlight the most important items.

- Greys:
  - #d8d7c7: Used for backgrounds, text, and buttons.
  - #768581: Utilized for buttons and the banner background.
  - #4c514e: Present in darker button shades.

- Orange:
  - #C34A36: Employed for the navbar background and certain accents.

- Other Colors:
  - Transparent orange hue indicating pending status of the booking.
  - Transparent green tint signifying approved status of the booking.
  - Transparent red shade denoting cancelled status of the booking.

- Overall, the color palette gives a professional and muted appearance, with the orange accents adding a touch of vibrancy. It offers a clean and modern aesthetic.

  - ![colors](assets/images/colors.png)

### Typography
- The website primarily uses two fonts: Permanent Marker and Titillium Web. These fonts were specifically chosen for their unique combination of personality and readability. Permanent Marker adds informality and style to headings, while Titillium Web ensures clear readability for heading text. For the rest of the website, the fonts will be determined by the user's browser.

- To maintain visual consistency throughout the site, the fonts are adjusted dynamically with media queries to ensure optimal readability across various screen sizes. This means that font sizes will adapt to ensure the best reading experience on any device.

## Features
### Existing Features 
- Logo
  - The logo, featuring the title "Van's Transportation" alongside a small van icon, serves the dual purpose of clearly communicating the page's content and functionality to users, while also providing a consistent link to the home page visible across all screen sizes on the navigation bar.

    - ![logo ](assets/images/logo.png)

- Navigation Bar
  - The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of large screens, allowing seamless navigation between pages: Home, Make a Booking, View my Booking, Contact Us, and Account. Within the Account section, users can access a dropdown for logging in or registering. At the end of the navigation tabs, the username is displayed if logged in, or "You are not logged in" if not. On small screens, the navigation bar is hidden to improve content accessibility and can be accessed through a dropdown menu activated by clicking the three horizontal lines symbol.

- Make a Booking page
  - Booking a service is a pivotal feature of the website, facilitating the process of scheduling appointments. Users are required to fill out all fields in the form, including their phone number, desired service, booking date, and additional comments. The comments section allows users to provide specific details such as their address, type of waste collection, or preferences regarding van pick-up or drop-off locations. This comprehensive form ensures that users can provide all necessary information to streamline the booking process effectively. Need to be log in to be able to make a booking.

    - Small Screen sizes:
      - ![make booking small screens](assets/images/makebookingss.png)

  - After making a booking, the user receives the message "Your booking request has been submitted successfully," providing reassurance and confirmation that their request has been received and processed by the system. This message adds value to the user by instilling confidence in the booking process, offering peace of mind that their service request has been successfully communicated to the company, and setting clear expectations for next steps in the service process. Additionally, the user is automatically redirected to the "View My Booking" page, allowing them to conveniently track the status of their booking and access any relevant details or updates.

  - If a user attempts to book a time slot that has already been booked by someone else, they will receive an error message stating: "Sorry, but the time slot you selected is no longer available. Please choose a different time slot that suits your schedule." This prompt is crucial as it promptly informs the user that the desired time slot is unavailable, allowing them to swiftly adjust their booking preferences without further delay.

- Your Booking page
  - Users can view all of their previous bookings and their current statuses by accessing the relevant page on the website. To view this information, users must be logged in. Pending bookings will be highlighted in transparent orange, confirmed bookings in transparent green, and cancelled bookings in transparent red.

  - Additionally, users have the option to modify or cancel their bookings, which gives them greater flexibility and control over their scheduled services. If a confirmed booking is modified, the user will need to wait for confirmation from the admin once again.
  
  - This feature enhances user experience by offering transparency, clarity, and convenient management of booking statuses.

  - Upon updating a booking, the user receives a confirmation message. To delete a booking, the user's details are shown, and they confirm deletion by pressing the delete button again or the back button, redirecting them to the view bookings page. These confirmation messages and security measures ensure a smooth and secure user experience when managing bookings on the platform.

## Bugs 
### Unfixed Bugs

- The current web URL extensions are causing repetition of names, which can create confusion and negatively impact search engine optimization. Although this issue has been identified, it cannot be addressed immediately due to time constraints. However, resolving this issue is relatively simple by adjusting the URL configuration of the apps to ensure consistency and clarity in naming conventions.

  - ![url-repeating](assets/images/urlsrepeating.png)

- In Gitpod's terminal, Python detected three issues related to the gitpod.yml extension. However, these issues do not affect the functionality of the project.

  - ![problems-gitpod](assets/images/problems-gitpod.png)

- While checking the HTML code via URI, the website encountered four errors related to the Summernote Editor. However, these issues do not affect the project's functionality.
